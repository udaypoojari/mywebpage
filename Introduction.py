### A little about me...

I am Uday Kumar Poojari, a mechanical engineer who has extraordinary software development skills and sound product development experience.
As such, I originally started my career in product development (CAE- computer aided engineering) before becoming
fascinated with automation, software development, data science and their intersection with product development.
Now, I work as a software developer to rapidize the product development in automotive and aerospace domain. 

I am a team player who is also comfortable working independently. I 
have demonstrated these qualities throughout my career. They are also demonstrated by my work ethic and interpersonal 
relationships. I am flexible, versatile, and a very quick learner of new technologies and their implementation.
